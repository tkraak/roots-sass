# Roots with SASS and Autoprefixer

The static site compiler [roots](http://roots.cx) is configured for [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) out-of-the-box, but roots is more than flexible enough to handle any number of pre and post CSS processors you may want to use.

This repository is an attempt to document how you can use roots with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) with the popular [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugin thrown into the mix.

### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`

### More documentaton soon ...
